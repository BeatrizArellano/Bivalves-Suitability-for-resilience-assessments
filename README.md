# From historians to forecasters: the potential of bivalve records to assess resilience and provide early warnings for marine tipping points 

This repository relates to the manuscript "From historians to forecasters: the potential of bivalve records to assess resilience and provide early warnings for marine tipping points" published in Limnology & Oceanography Letters Special Issue on Sclerochronology.

The Python code in this repository reproduces the main results obtained in our study. 
The resilience metrics (lag-1 autocorrelation and variance) are computed using the `regimeshifts` library found [here](https://github.com/BeatrizArellano/regimeshifts).
